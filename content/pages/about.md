I am a data scientist at [Catawiki.com](https://www.catawiki.com/) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. My primary goal is to delight our customers by helping them to find their perfect unique objects _before_ their auctions end. I have a background in theoretical physics, but these days I mostly think about how to apply machine learning to practical problems, how to keep models fresh and up to date, how to do data science sustainably, and generally how to get the most out of our data.

Born in the UK, I lived as a child in Scotland, England, a [German exclave in Switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buesingen), the USA, and, for most of my life, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I completed my bachelor's in physics in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and my master's in theoretical physics in Uppsala, Sweden, writing theses on [nuclear fusion energy](/static/Paton_Capstone.pdf) and [string theory](http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A937707&dswid=9140). In November 2016 I began working as a Data Scientist and Consultant at KPMG, returning to live in Amsterdam. I joined Catawiki in January 2019.
