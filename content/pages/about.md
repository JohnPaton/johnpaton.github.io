I am a data scientist at [Catawiki.com](https://www.catawiki.com/) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. My primary goal is to delight our customers by helping them to find their perfect unique objects _before_ their auctions end. That is the fancy way of saying I mostly work on personalization, but as Catawiki is a growing company my role also includes various other data science projects as they arise.

I have a background in theoretical physics, but these days I mostly think about how to apply machine learning to practical problems, how to keep models fresh and up to date in the face of changing preferences, and generally how to get the most out of our data. I'm also very interested in _sustainable data science_, which I consider to be basically any automation of the technical but non-data-science tasks that data scientists do: model deployments, maintaining single sources of truth, compute resource provisioning, code formatting, whatever.

Born in the UK, I lived as a child in Scotland, England, a [German exclave in Switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buesingen), the USA, and, for most of my life, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I completed my bachelor's in physics in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and my master's in theoretical physics in Uppsala, Sweden, writing theses on [nuclear fusion energy](/static/Paton_Capstone.pdf) and [string theory](http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A937707&dswid=9140). In November 2016 I began working as a Data Scientist and Consultant at KPMG, returning to live in Amsterdam. I joined Catawiki in January 2019.
