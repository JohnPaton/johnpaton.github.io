I am a [data scientist & consultant at KPMG](https://home.kpmg.com/xx/en/home/insights/2015/01/data-and-analytics.html) in the Netherlands. As a consultant, I try to understand the problems clients have and how their data can contribute to a solution. As a data scientist I build that solution, usually by applying machine learning techniques, which I'm always learning more about. I'm a Python fanboy but I've dabbled in Matlab/Octave too. In my free time I like [travelling](https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1h_e3IiQFZbJ_KM7nxliIOSpVTfE), beer, whiskey, and board games.  

Born in the UK, I lived as a child in Scotland, England, a [German exclave in Switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buesingen), the USA, and, for most of my life, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I completed my bachelor's in Physics in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and my master's in theoretical physics in Uppsala, Sweden, where I wrote my [thesis on string theory](http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A937707&dswid=9140). In November 2016 I began working at KPMG, returning to live in Amsterdam.
