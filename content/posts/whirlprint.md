summary: 

On and off over the past year I have been working on a generative art project that I like to call WhirlPrint. The basic idea is to use an NLP-model to generate sentence-embeddings of a personal message. These embeddings are then used to seed a 2D-field of coherent noise. From the gradients in the noise we can then generate a sort of streamline diagram, coloring the streamlines as we please. The end result is basically a very indirect (but very beautiful, in my opinion) method of visualizing the sentence embeddings. As we know, [similar messages will produce similar embeddings](../remapping-the-world/#word-vectors), so the resulting image somehow captures the meaning behind the words that you put in. This makes for a unique and meaningful piece of data-art, even for non-data-lovers. 

In this post I'd like to demo a few of WhirlPrint's capabilities, as well as shamelessly promote my [new Etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/WhirlPrint) of the same name.
